        <h2>Why the Project?</h2>
        <p>
            Stubble burning in modern agriculture is a major environmental and health issue. While it offers a quick solution for clearing fields, it results in severe air pollution, soil degradation, and long-term ecological damage. The burning of stubble releases harmful pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM2.5), which significantly deteriorate air quality, leading to respiratory illnesses and contributing to climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
            The environmental cost is equally alarming, with greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exacerbating global warming. Additionally, this practice harms soil health by depleting vital nutrients, forcing farmers to rely heavily on chemical fertilizers, which can further degrade soil quality and raise costs. Given the urgency of addressing these issues, our project offers a sustainable alternative.

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Our solution, the Electric Stubble Churning Machine, provides an eco-friendly alternative to stubble burning. The machine works by using electricity to churn crop residue directly into the soil, enriching it with organic matter and improving fertility. This process eliminates the need for burning, thus reducing harmful emissions and contributing to better air quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond its environmental benefits, the machine enhances soil structure, reduces dependence on synthetic fertilizers, and promotes more sustainable farming practices. Designed for scalability, it can be used by both small and large-scale farmers, offering a cost-effective solution to stubble management while improving agricultural productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            By adopting this innovative approach, farmers can not only reduce their environmental footprint but also boost long-term soil health and crop yields, making agriculture more sustainable for future generations.

                <h3>MANUALLY DRIVEN</h3>
                <P>
                <strong>Iteration 1 :</strong> This design utilises an independent electric motor to drive the machine's churning blades. The engine powers the axle and rotating blades to churn the stubble, aiding in faster decomposition efficiency. By employing an electric motor, this concept allows for a controlled and adjustable speed setting, optimising churning action to handle varying soil types and stubble thicknesses effectively. The motor-driven model is particularly beneficial for farmers looking to reduce reliance on the tractor's power take-off (PTO) shaft, enabling use with minimal tractor dependency and flexibility for off-grid applications.

                <h3>MOTOR DRIVEN</h3>
                <P>
                <strong>Iteration 2 :</strong> This version of the stubble churning machine connects directly to a tractor's power take-off (PTO) shaft, using the tractor's engine power to drive the churning blades. The PTO-driven model leverages the tractor's mechanical energy, eliminating the need for an external motor while utilising available farm machinery. The axle and blade assemblies are powered directly by the tractor's PTO shaft, making this concept a cost-effective and straightforward solution, especially for farmers with smaller land holdings who prioritise lower operational costs.

                <h3>PTO SHAFT DRIVEN</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Iteration 3 :</strong> The hand-driven Machine is a manually operated tool for small-scale stubble churning and soil preparation. Unlike motorised or PTO-driven models, this design leverages human power to rotate the blades and churn the soil and stubble. Ideal for small farms or gardens, this lightweight and eco-friendly model offers simplicity, affordability, and ease of transport. Its compact form makes it perfect for precise stubble management in smaller areas without heavy machinery, allowing for efficient soil preparation in narrow or hard-to-reach spots.
